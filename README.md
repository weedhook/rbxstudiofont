# roblox font changer

## requirements
python 3.x
and of course roblox studio

## usage
clone this & put your fonts within the fonts folder.
run the self.py
it'll list the fetched fonts within content/font

use `replace <index> "the font name within folder"
for example replace 61 "ProggyClean" (DONT ADD .ttf, i didnt add a check for that as it'll just automatically add it)
( it'll then restart/load up roblox studio )

anyone let me know if this makes changing fonts easier and better```
